# Sales-Force-Clone
This is a simple Salesforce clone made using only HTML and CSS. I created this project to practice my web design skills and to understand how CRM (Customer Relationship Management) interfaces look and work. It includes basic pages and layouts  are almost similar to Salesforce. This is just for learning and improving my front-end design.
